# Blood_Donation_Management

## Introduction 
A blood donation is a procedure in which a person voluntarily consents to have blood drawn for use in transfusions that will later be necessary in hospitals for medical procedures that call for them. Whole blood donations are possible (blood that is taken directly from the body), or of certain blood elements including red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, and platelets.

The aim of this project is to establish a blood bank information system that focuses on creating an online system that is accessible for both donors and administrators, as well as strengthening blood banks in Vietnam. Donors can access information about their previous blood donations, such as blood test results and contribution patterns, to help them plan their upcoming donations, and they can also update their personal information through the system.

## Conclusion

We can understand in a simple and complete way how to build a project for Principles of Database Management. Gain more knowledge about the blood donation process and relationships between entities, understand more about attributes, and binary relationships, how to collect data, how to draw an entity-relationship diagram and a relationship model; and how to translate from an entity-diagram to a relational database.
